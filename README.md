# What's This?
This is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) style markdown document that outllines an alternative creation story that you can use in your TTRPG campaigns.

## Objections
### "Blasphamy - My God[s] is/are the only true God[s] and my creation story is the only true creation story."
Yeah, I know some people believe this and I don't mean to step on anyone's toes.  This is a work of fiction.  It borrows from other creation stories in style and subject matter, but it's a work of fiction.  If you do choose to make a religion around this, please see the License.txt file included.  
### "But this is different from my TTRPG creation story"
I hope so.  This is an ALTERNATIVE to that.  It lays out the universe differently and the interactions between planes / spheres / etc differently.  It also allows for multiple planets in parallel.

# Usage
To use this in your Obsidian vault, simply clone it into the directory in which you would like it placed.  You can rename the top level folder if you wish and everything should still work.

# Issues
Possible Issues:
* Naming conflicts - You might already have notes with similar titles
* Plugins - Some plugins may cause unanticipated formatting changes

# Apologists and Scientists
## Tah
I wanted a simple name for a benevelont, though distant creator. who outsourced creation to lesser entities.  Tah is British and Australian (possibly elsewhere) slang for "Thanks".  (Spelled "Ta").

## Quarks and Sciency Stuff
I wanted some tie in to our understanding of the universe.  So the vibrations that Tah creates at the beginning are the vibrations that fragment into strings - and the strings, poking into the universe, are the basis of the fundamental sub-particles.  My understanding of this is limited and this is all fiction, so I may get it wrong.  Send a PR if you have a better idea.

## The Song
I really liked the imagry of The Silmarillion where creation was born of a song.  Although the vibration making a single note is presented, I want you to imagine something well beyond the frequencies of ultra-violet light and into the string theory range of vibrating energy.  

## Timelines
I don't have actual dates on these events.  We can put that together later.  While Tah sleeps, I am imagining billions of years pass.
